# SVM Classifier on Iris Dataset

# 📖 Description

This project applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify the Iris dataset into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

# 🧠 Model Explanation

SVM is a supervised learning model that finds the optimal hyperplane separating data into classes. It works well for clear margin separation and is effective in high-dimensional spaces.

## ✅ Benefits

- Handles both linear and non-linear classification using kernels
  
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
  
- Robust to overfitting (especially with proper kernel)

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Slower on large datasets
  
- Requires tuning of kernel and regularization parameters

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name:** Iris Dataset
  
- **Source:** scikit-learn
  
- **Features:** Sepal/Petal Length & Width
  
- **Target:** Flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
