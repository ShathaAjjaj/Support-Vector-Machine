ðŸ§  What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and sometimes regression.

It tries to find the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes of data.

It focuses on the support vectors (data points closest to the boundary) to make decisions.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal of SVM (in classification):

To find a line (in 2D) or hyperplane (in higher dimensions) that:

Maximizes the margin (distance between the line and the nearest data points from both classes).

Classifies data points correctly.
